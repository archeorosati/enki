🚀 **Unveiling the Past with Artificial Intelligence**  

**Enki**—named after the Sumerian deity of knowledge, Enki (𒀭𒂗𒆤)—is an open-source deep learning framework designed to **detect and analyze archaeological sites** through **computer vision** and **remote sensing**. By leveraging satellite imagery, GIS data, and advanced deep learning models, Enki helps researchers uncover hidden ancient landscapes with unprecedented precision.

## 🌍 **Why Enki?**  
- 🏺 **AI-Driven Archaeological Research** – Automates the detection of **tells, settlements, and historical structures**.  
- 🛰 **Remote Sensing & GIS Integration** – Processes imagery from **Google Satellite, Bing Maps, and open geospatial datasets**.  
- 🧠 **State-of-the-Art Deep Learning Models** – Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained on high-resolution datasets.  
- 📖 **Open & Reproducible Research** – Licensed under **CC-BY-SA 4.0**, ensuring transparency and community-driven advancements.

## 📂 **Datasets & Acknowledgments**  
Enki is trained on high-quality satellite and aerial imagery datasets, including:  
- 🔗 **[Enki Datasets on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/XXXXX)**  
- 🏺 **[Ancient Near East (ANE) Project](https://zenodo.org/records/6384045)** *(CC-BY-SA 4.0)*  

These datasets provide a robust foundation for machine learning applications in archaeology, enhancing our ability to analyze vast landscapes.

## 🔥 **Get Involved**  
💡 We welcome contributions, feedback, and collaborations! Whether you're an AI researcher, archaeologist, or GIS expert, your input can help improve Enki’s models and expand its capabilities.
